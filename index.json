Understanding and analyzing dreams can provide valuable insights into our emotions, fears, and desires. When we take the time to interpret our dreams, we begin to unravel the complex tapestry of our inner thoughts. This process not only helps us understand ourselves better but also allows us to connect our past experiences with our present circumstances and future possibilities. By delving into the meanings behind specific dreams, we can gain clarity about unresolved issues from our past. These dreams often reflect our memories, traumas, and lessons learned, reminding us of what we need to confront or embrace. Moreover, dreams can serve as a guide for our future, revealing our aspirations and potential paths we may take. They can provide warnings or encouragement, nudging us toward decisions that align with our true selves. Ultimately, dream interpretation is more than just a curious pastime; it is a profound practice that bridges our past, present, and future. By engaging with our dreams, we can unlock the hidden messages they carry, leading us toward greater self-awareness and personal growth. Note\rThis article is a shameful copy of the great Grav original page\r. If you want to know about the extended Markdown syntax of KeepIt theme, please read extended Markdown syntax page\r. Let’s face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages. Markdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it. Some of the key benefits are: Markdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters, so it’s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in Markdown. Produces valid XHTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use! John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this: The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. – John Gruber Without further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like!

Identifiers can be numbers or words, but they can’t contain spaces or tabs. Identifiers only correlate the footnote reference with the footnote itself — in the output, footnotes are numbered sequentially. Add the footnote using another caret and number inside brackets with a colon and text ([^1]: My footnote.). You don’t have to put footnotes at the end of the document.
